# Warzone Cat Ears v2.1.0

Author: RaiRaiTheRaichu

Additional credits:
- SamSWAT for the initial mod this is inherited from, "Crye Precision Airframe Helmet From Warzone".

### ---BUILT FOR SPT VERSION 4.1.2---

We all know SPT needs more accessories. What's the point of all the killing if you aren't going to look good while you do it?

I've taken the same mesh for the Cat Ear headband from SamSWAT's "Crye Precision Airframe Helmet From Warzone" mod and edited the mesh to fit and look proper in the SLAAP plate slot of any helmet that can accept one. I've also added a few alternate textures, in case blue isn't your thing.
We've got blue, pink, red, green, and yellow.

Oh, and of course you don't have to forego protection just for style. Enabled by default, I have added a config option to copy the protection/hitbox of a normal SLAAP plate, so you don't have to lose out on your armor. Does it make sense? Probably not, but who cares? Cat ears, bro.

Alternatively, run `dotnet build -c Release` from the project directory root.

The output will be stored in the project's `bin\Release\` folder.
